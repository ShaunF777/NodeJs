/**üß† Concepts Reinforced in the Comments

Async function always returns a promise.

If you return "hi", that‚Äôs actually Promise.resolve("hi").

If you throw err, that‚Äôs actually Promise.reject(err).

await is syntactic sugar for ‚Äúwait for this promise to resolve.‚Äù

If the promise fulfills ‚Üí you get the value.

If the promise rejects ‚Üí control jumps into the nearest catch.

try/catch in async = handles rejections the same way .catch() handles rejected promises.

Re-throwing errors is how you ‚Äúbubble up‚Äù failures to an outer handler.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
üîë Analogy (so it sticks)

Think of async/await + try/catch like waiting at a restaurant:
await = sit at your table until the waiter brings your food (promise fulfilled).
If the kitchen messes up ‚Üí waiter comes with bad news, you immediately jump to the complaint desk (catch).
If everything is fine, you keep eating and move on to dessert (next await).
If you throw the problem back out of the kitchen ‚Üí your manager (outer catch) now has to deal with it. */




// Not so good way of runnung the getDogPic async function
/* console.log('1: Will get dog pics!');
//const x = getDogPic(); // Run's backend, and only serves when done.
//console.log(x); // Will return 'Promise { <pending> }'
// But this way getDogPic returns a promise, .then method gives access to it's future output ('2: Ready üêï‚Äçü¶∫üêï‚Äçü¶∫üêï‚Äçü¶∫')
getDogPic()
  .then((x) => {
    console.log(x);
    console.log('3: Done getting dog pics!'); // All other output that we want after the async function, must be inside .then block
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.log('ERROR üí£');
  }); */

/**So in real life, this sort of stuff happens all the time.
So we have an Async function and we called it from another Async function, and maybe we even
called another Async function from that first Async function, and so we have a bunch of these
Async functions interacting with each other. And so it's very important that you know
how all of this works. */
